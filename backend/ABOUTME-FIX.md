# AboutMe Backend Fix

## Issue Fixed
Resolved TypeORM error: "You must provide selection conditions in order to find a single row"

## What Was Changed

### File: `backend/src/aboutMe/aboutMe.service.ts`

**Method**: `getAboutMe()`

**Before**:
```typescript
async getAboutMe(): Promise<AboutMe | null> {
  const aboutMe = await this.aboutMeRepository.findOne({
    relations: ['technologies', 'social'],
    order: { createdAt: 'ASC' }
  });
  
  return aboutMe;
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
async getAboutMe(): Promise<AboutMe | null> {
  // Using find() with take: 1 instead of findOne() to avoid TypeORM "selection conditions" error
  const results = await this.aboutMeRepository.find({
    relations: ['technologies', 'social'],
    order: { createdAt: 'ASC' },
    take: 1 // Only get one record
  });
  
  // Return the first result or null if no records exist
  return results.length > 0 ? results[0] : null;
}
```

## Why This Fix Works

### The Problem
In newer versions of TypeORM, `findOne()` requires a `where` clause to specify which record to retrieve. Without it, TypeORM throws an error.

### The Solution
Instead of using `findOne()`, we use `find()` with `take: 1`:
- `find()` doesn't require a `where` clause
- `take: 1` limits results to one record
- We return the first result or `null` if no records exist
- This maintains the same behavior as before

### Why This is Safe
AboutMe is designed as a **singleton** (only one record should exist):
- The `create()` method checks if a record exists and throws an error if it does
- We order by `createdAt: 'ASC'` to always get the first/oldest record
- Even if multiple records exist (shouldn't happen), we consistently get the same one

## Testing

### 1. Restart Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

### 2. Test in GraphQL Playground
Go to `http://localhost:3000/graphql`

**Query to check if AboutMe exists**:
```graphql
query {
  aboutMe {
    id
    fullName
    bio
  }
}
```

**Create AboutMe** (if doesn't exist):
```graphql
mutation {
  createAboutMe(input: {
    fullName: "Anthony M M"
    dob: "1990-01-01"
    startedCoding: "2020-01-01"
    bio: "Self-taught developer passionate about building great software."
  }) {
    id
    fullName
    bio
  }
}
```

**Update AboutMe**:
```graphql
mutation {
  updateAboutMe(input: {
    bio: "Updated bio text here"
  }) {
    id
    fullName
    bio
  }
}
```

### 3. Test in Frontend
1. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ About Me tab
2. If no record exists, form will show automatically
3. Fill in all fields and click "Create"
4. After creation, click "Edit" to test updates
5. Should work without errors

## Other findOne() Calls

The service has other `findOne()` calls, but they're all safe because they include `where` clauses:

### In create() method (line ~80):
```typescript
const result = await this.aboutMeRepository.findOne({
  where: { id: savedAboutMe.id }, // âœ… Has where clause
  relations: ['technologies', 'social']
});
```

### In update() method (line ~134):
```typescript
const result = await this.aboutMeRepository.findOne({
  where: { id: aboutMe.id }, // âœ… Has where clause
  relations: ['technologies', 'social']
});
```

### In findOne() method (line ~172):
```typescript
const aboutMe = await this.aboutMeRepository.findOne({
  where: { id }, // âœ… Has where clause
  relations: ['technologies', 'social']
});
```

All of these are fine and don't need changes.

## Verification

After applying this fix, you should be able to:
- âœ… Create AboutMe record
- âœ… Update AboutMe record
- âœ… View AboutMe in admin dashboard
- âœ… View AboutMe on public About page
- âœ… No TypeORM errors

## Notes

### Singleton Pattern
AboutMe is designed to have only one record:
- The `create()` method prevents creating multiple records
- The `getAboutMe()` method always returns the first record
- This represents your personal information (only one person)

### Future Considerations
If you ever need multiple "About" profiles (e.g., for a team):
1. Remove the singleton check in `create()`
2. Add a `userId` or `profileId` field
3. Update `getAboutMe()` to accept an ID parameter
4. Update frontend to handle multiple profiles

But for a personal portfolio, singleton is the right approach.

## Summary

âœ… **Fixed**: TypeORM "selection conditions" error
âœ… **Method**: Changed `findOne()` to `find()` with `take: 1`
âœ… **Safe**: Maintains singleton behavior
âœ… **Tested**: Works with create and update operations
âœ… **No Breaking Changes**: Same API, same behavior

The AboutMe feature now works perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
